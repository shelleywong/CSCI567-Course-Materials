## [Moodle](https://moodle.csuchico.edu)
I'll be using a Moodle page for this course this semester. Moodle will provide a mechanism for occasional quiz questions related to the material in the course. It will also be used to hold the grades for the assignments. A link to Piazza is on the class Moodle page.

### Piazza Discussion Board
We will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions directly to me, I encourage you to post your general questions on Piazza. Any questions that could violate the cheating policy if asked should be emailed directly to me. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.
