# Assignment 5 - REST API

The goal of Assignment 5 is to give you experience working with a [REST API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api), specifically an external API that you do not control (you will need to make HTTP requests, handle responses, and follow the rules of the API). REST is one of the most widely used approaches for building web-based APIs, and it is useful for you to be familiar with how to interact with a REST API from the client side. Sending and/or receiving data from a REST API (or other internet-based source) is one option for meeting the Final Project requirement that your project needs to integrate with a backend to utilize and manage data and leverage the fact the app is on a device with internet connectivity.

  * [Submitting your code](#submitting-your-code)
  * [Commit your code to the assignment5 branch](#commit-your-code-to-the-assignment5-branch)

## Requirements

In this assignment your app needs to:

* **Have a simple UI**
  * Your UI should be user-friendly. Every feature should have a purpose, and it should be clear to users how they can interact with each feature.
* **Retrieve data from a REST API**
  * You must successfully make at least one HTTP GET request using the [Dart http package](https://pub.dev/packages/http) to fetch data from an external API (a third-party service that you do not have direct control over).
    * The data returned by your chosen REST API should contain at least one object that is composed of at least three fields that can be effectively displayed or used.
  * To receive full credit for this assignment, use a different REST API from the one demonstrated in class.
    * Feel free to use a free and public API. Some free/public APIs require an API key, but you do not need to use an API Key for this assignment.
* **Display data received from a REST API in the View**
  * Present the data received from the REST API in a clear and user-friendly manner within the view (so that users can see a representation of the state of the resource in the user interface).
    * You are not required to display the entire response, but you must showcase at least one object and at least three different fields from the object, utilizing widgets to effectively display the values (e.g. using Text, ListTile, or Card) or using the values in a meaningful way (e.g. launching a URL with a GestureDetector or button)
    * The data should not be presented in its raw transferred state (e.g. if you receive JSON data, the data should not be displayed in JSON format). Instead, use appropriate widgets to provide a clear and visually appealing representation.

Also make sure that you:
  * Submit the assignment correctly
    * Use a branch called `assignment5`
    * Submit to your CSCI567 GitLab repo
      * You may submit your app as either an Android app or a web app. Your CSCI567 GitLab repo on the `assignment5` branch should contain (at minimum):
        * Android submission: the code for your app (the project directory) and the APK file that you created for your app
        * Web submission: the code for your app (the project directory), the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that defines the CI/CD pipeline for your GitLab repo, and a file called `web.md` that contains the URL to your project hosted online through GitLab Pages

As long as your app does the tasks described above and is submitted correctly, you will get credit for this assignment.

> Note: Some APIs will not work on web by default (they require CORS support to be enabled, and you may not have control over this). For this assignment, you may want to submit with an Android APK (which does not run into the CORS support issue) or find an API that works on web without additional configurations necessary. More info about CORS: [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

> Note: If you are deploying to Android and [fetching data from the internet](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data), make sure you add the Internet permission to the Android Manifest. If you do not include this, your app may work in debug/development mode, but it will not work in release mode (I am grading the release version of your app).

## Getting Graded

You may submit Assignment 5 as either an Android APK (Option 1) OR a GitLab Pages Website (Option 2) -- you do not need to submit both. After completing Option 1 or Option 2, remember to add, commit, and push your code to the `assignment5` branch to complete your submission!

### Android APK

Create a new APK for this assignment by running the `flutter clean` command, and then running the `flutter build apk` command. For more detailed instructions on creating and locating an APK, refer back to the instructions in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/shelleywong/CSCI567-Course-Materials/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment1.md#create-your-first-apk).

When you have your APK, move it to the root directory of your GIT repo that you were given to turn in assignments for this class. You must only have **one** APK in your root directory (remember, each assignment should be submitted to a unique branch, so you can overwrite any previous APKs).

For this assignment you should have a directory that looks like the following:

```
/
    README.md
    app-release.apk
    AssignmentProject/
        android/
        lib/
        web/
        pubspec.yaml
        (Rest of the AssignmentProject app/project files and folders)
```

### GitLab Pages Website

To submit via web, make sure you have a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file on the current branch and have updated the pipeline for the current assignment. You should also have a file called `web.md` that contains a web URL for your assignment hosted online. This will be the same web URL as any previous GitLab Pages submissions -- if you are doing web submissions for Assignments 3-7, you must make sure that each assignment still meets the requirements of the previous assignments. You will always only have one GitLab Pages website, so doing this ensures that your deployment will meet the requirements of each assignment (regardless of when the assignment actually gets graded).

```
/
    .gitlab-ci.yml
    README.md
    web.md
    AssignmentProject/
        android/
        lib/
        web/
        pubspec.yaml
        (Rest of the AssignmentProject app/project files and folders)
```

> Note: the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is a hidden file, so you will not see it if you run the `ls` command without any options. You can see the .gitlab-ci.yml file if you list hidden files in long format using `ls -al`

### Submitting your code

Your code should be submitted to your CSCI567 repo (in the CSUC-CSCI567 GitLab group). You should use git commands in a command line terminal to record changes to your project and push your updates to a remote repo.

> Note: I recommend **not** using VSCode, GitHub Desktop, or Android Studio to manage your version control -- several students who have tried using these in the past have ended up screwing up their repos. Any issues you run into will be much easier to fix if you consistently use git commands in a terminal.

### Commit your code to the assignment5 branch

```bash
git checkout -b assignment5  #create branch and switch to it
git status #show the working tree status to confirm what changes have been made
git add -A  #add all (if you want to add all changes listed when you run 'git status')
git commit -m "Assignment 5 Submission"  #Commit changes to branch
git push origin assignment5  #Push code up to assignment5 branch on remote
```

Make sure your branch is exactly named `assignment5` matching the case, spacing, etc as my grading script will only pull your submission if it matches exactly.

If you plan on making multiple updates to the code on this branch, you can include the `--set-upstream` option when you push the code (i.e. `git push --set-upstream origin assignment5`) -- this adds an upstream (tracking) reference so that, any time you push or pull from this branch in the future, you can simply use `git push` or `git pull`, without specifying the remote and branch.

If you would like to merge your `assignment5` branch with your `main` branch, you can run the following commands:
```bash
git checkout main  #switch to the main branch
git merge assignment5  #join the development history from the assignment5 branch with the current (main) branch
git push origin main  #push the assignment5 history up to the main branch on the remote
```
