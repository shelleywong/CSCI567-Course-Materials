# CINS467 Syllabus

## Instructor

Shelley Wong

## Prerequisite

CINS 370 with a grade of C or higher, or CSCI 211 and MINS 335, or MINS 325 and MINS 335. (or approved equivalents, check with your advisor)

Students who take this class without completing the prerequisite class will be given a failing grade.

## Course Accounts

* Canvas
  * [Chico State Canvas](https://canvas.csuchico.edu/) - This class is being taught using Canvas this semester. Make sure you are able to access my section of CINS 467.
* PollEverywhere
  * [Login/Create Account](https://www.polleverywhere.com/auth/saml/csuchico) - If you have not already done so, create an account and login to PollEverywhere. PollEverywhere will be used during lectures for feedback and to track participation. There is a campus license for PollEverywhere and for your participation to be registered, your account must be tied to your csuchico email.
  * [pollev.com/techturtle](https://pollev.com/techturtle) - This is the PollEv link that will be used during lectures throughout the semester.

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course. 

Instead, throughout the semester, we will reference official documentation and other resources that are readily available online. See the [CINS 467 Useful Links](https://github.com/shelleywong/CINS467-Course-Materials/blob/main/Links.md) provided in my GitHub repo, and look for links provided during class as we work through each module.

## Attendance

Attendance is highly recommended. A portion of the final exam grade is based on lecture attendance (tracked through PollEverywhere questions) and lab help session attendance (tracked through a sign-in sheet). You need to attend 80% of lectures and lab help sessions to receive full credit for this portion of the grade.

Missing class can make the projects and exams especially difficult. If I verbally change the requirements of a project during lecture, you are responsible for meeting the new requirements. If you miss a class, make sure you review the lecture recordings and/or get notes from another student.

If you regularly skip class I will not answer questions on the material you missed.

I understand that things happen. If you need to miss an occasional class for any reason, you should send me an email ASAP with an explanation of your situation (ideally BEFORE the class you need to miss, but letting me know afterwards is better than not letting me know at all). Depending on the circumstances, you may be excused for the absence.

## Grading

Grades for this course will be relative. The students that do the best work will get an A in the course. B grades indicate very good work, C grades indicate adequate work, and so on. I will likely not be following at traditional percentage grades of 90% for an A, 80% for a B, etc., and I don't like to grade on a curve as if I applied blindly could result in grades actually being lowered if everyone is doing very well in the course.

I will post grades to Canvas. If you are not happy with a grade, talk to me immediately. If you do not talk to me within a week of the posting of a grade, I will assume you think the grade is fair and accurate, and you will lose your right to dispute the grade.


### Grade Category Percentages

* Final Project 60% of course grade
> The final project grade includes:
> - the Final Project itself,
> - the Project Proposal,
> - Project Progress Updates,
> - the Final Project Presentation,
> - Lecture and Lab Help Session Attendance,
> - Presentation Feedback Forms, and
> - The Final Project Feedback Form

* Individual Programming Projects 40% of course grade
> Assignments will be posted in Canvas (with due dates and links if applicable)

### Grading Meetings

We are going to investigate all the projects you turn in to look for code plagiarism via a number of different methods. Any students whose code isn't uniquely yours will need to schedule a grading meeting with the grader to answer detailed questions concerning how your code works. This meeting will make up 60% of your project grade and 40% will come from your ability to solve the project. If you didn't write your project you will likely fail the grading meeting and get a failing grade on the project. Seeking out fellow students for advice on how to get started is perfectly acceptable; however, do your own work and make sure you have a firm understanding of how your code works.

### Programming Assignments and Final Project

At the beginning of the semester, there will be several assignments due at approximately 1 week intervals. There will also be one larger web or mobile project that will require you to create a plan and make progress on your own on a regular/weekly basis. At the end of the semester, you will present your project. Plan on being in attendance for all project presentations.

### Late Assignments

Programming assignments turned in up to 1 week after the due date will lose 15%. Assignments will NOT be accepted more than 1 week after the due date. The Final Project and all components of the project MUST be completed and submitted by the end of finals week.

## Getting Help/E-mail

Feel free to make use of my office hours or send me a message if you have any questions. You may also get help from tutors or other students on the unofficial student-run Chico State CS Discord; however, remember that this is an upper division course centered on a unique final project. While this provides an excellent opportunity for you to get experience working on a large-ish project (larger than most classroom projects) and that could potentially be put on a resume, be aware that you may run into problems that no one else has run into before.

Since Discord acts as a discussion board, accessible to me and many other students and instructors, you may get a response more quickly if you post there. HOWEVER, there are many cases when posting code to a discussion board (or any public place) may be considered cheating. If your question is related to your code, and your question requires that you show another person your code, send me an email (or potentially see if someone can help you individually, without you posting code in a public place). If you are sending me an email, make sure you put 'CINS467' in the subject so it will be filtered correctly; otherwise, I may not open your message or respond to it.

I try to respond as soon as possible to emails. If I have not responded within 24 hours, you may try sending a follow up email if you are still running into issues.

I will routinely communicate with the class via announcements on Canvas. You should receive notifications of all announcements soon after they are posted. It is your responsibility to check these messages regularly so that you do not miss important information about the class.

## Responsibilities

Taken from Professor Tyson Henry's 211 syllabus as it's a good statement concerning responsibilities for any given course:

I am responsible for providing useful and interesting (and I hope entertaining) lectures, meaningful and challenging assignments, challenging exams, abundant help, encouragement, advice, and most anything else I can do to help you learn the material.

Students are responsible for dedicating the time and effort necessary to learn the material. The amounts of time and effort required varies drastically. It may take you two hours/week to get an A in this class. It may take you 20 hours/week to get a C. It is your responsibility to figure out how much time you require and to invest that amount of time appropriate for you.

You will not learn the material if you don't put in the time and effort required. If you don't learn the material you will not be prepared for the subsequent classes and you will probably be very disappointed with your grade. While I will feel bad that I had to assign you a bad grade, if you don't put in the time necessary for success I will be forced to give you a low grade. The University requires that I assign grades based on your performance.

## Honesty

The first time you cheat, you will get a 0 on the test or assignment. The second time you cheat you will fail the class. It is not a good idea to cheat in my class. I will be following Tyson Henry's Cheating Policy until I put together one of my own.



>I expect all students to understand and follow the University?s honesty policies (http://www.csuchico.edu/prs/EMs/2004/04-036.shtml). I will fail students who do not follow these policies, even if they don't understand them. It is your responsibility to understand these policies.

>The bottom line is that you must do all the assignments on your own. Turning in code that anyone else wrote is cheating and will result in failing the course. Here are some examples of cheating:

>copying code from another student
>copying code from a book
>copying code from the Internet
>getting your friends to write your code
>paying someone else to write your code
>pestering other students until they give you their code
>buying code
>stealing code
>letting someone steal your code (e.g. giving out your password, or using incorrect file protection)
>giving your code to another student (both giving code and taking code are forms of cheating)
>giving your laptop that contains your program to another student
>getting so much help on an assignment that you are no longer doing the assignment (this can come from one helper or many helpers)
>crowdsourcing your code
>the list can go on...


>On the other hand, you are allowed to discuss projects and you may get help each other find bugs. Just make sure you don't get so much help that you are no longer doing the work.

>Required Consultation: If I suspect that you did not do your own work (e.g. someone else wrote your programs), you are required to meet with me and discuss your program. During this meeting I will ask you simple questions about your program. If you don't know how your program works I will assume you have cheated. In the event that you refuse to meet with me I will:

>+ 	assume you cheated

>+ 	give you a zero

>+ 	report you to Student Judicial Affairs.


>I reserve the right to catch cheaters after the end of the semester. Just because a cheater makes it to the end of the semester without being caught does not mean he or she has gotten away with it. Since I keep assignments it is possible for me to catch cheaters after the fact. For example, assume your friend George gives you his old program and you turn it in. Next semester George might give his program to someone else and I could catch it. Now I will look through all old programs to see who else George has given his program to. One of my advantages is that I can use programs to look for all instances of an assignment over the past several years. And while I might not catch everyone, I am always amazed at the people I do catch.

## Religious Holidays

I will work with students so this class and its assignments, exams, and activities do not interfere with religious holidays. However, you must notify me ahead of time so we can make appropriate arrangements.

## Americans with Disabilities Act

If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability or chronic illness, or if you need to make special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible, or see me during office hours. Please also contact Accessibility Resource Center (ARC) as they are the designated department responsible for approving and coordinating reasonable accommodations and services for students with disabilities. ARC will help you understand your rights and responsibilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and provide you further assistance with requesting and arranging accommodations.

## Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus.  I may also have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role. It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University. Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the Counseling and Wellness Center (898-6345) or Safe Place (898-3030).  Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related resources are available here: [www.csuchico.edu/title-ix](http://www.csuchico.edu/title-ix)


## Safe Zone Statement

I am part of the Safe Zone Ally community network of trained Chico State faculty/staff/students who are available to listen and support you in a safe and confidential manner. As a Safe Zone Ally, I can help you connect with resources on campus to address problems you may face that interfere with your academic and social success on campus as it relates to issues surrounding sexual orientation/gender identity. My goal is to help you be successful and to maintain a safe and equitable campus.

## LGBTQ Equality Statement

I am firmly committed to diversity and equality in all areas of campus life, including specifically members of the LGBTQ community. In this class I will work to promote an anti-discriminatory environment where everyone feels safe and welcome. I recognize that discrimination can be direct or indirect and take place at both institutional and personal levels. I believe that such discrimination is unacceptable and I am committed to providing equality of opportunity for all by eliminating any and all discrimination, harassment, bullying, or victimization. The success of this policy relies on the support and understanding of everyone in this class. We all have a responsibility not to be offensive to each other, or to participate in, or condone harassment or discrimination of any kind.

## Chico State Basic Needs Project

The Hungry Wildcat Food Pantry provides supplemental food, fresh produce, CalFresh application assistance and basic needs referral services for students experiencing food and housing insecurity.

All students are welcomed to visit the Pantry located in the Student Service Center 196, open Monday-Friday, 11am-4pm or call 530-898-4098. Please visit the [Chico State Basic Needs website](http://www.csuchico.edu/basic-needs) for more information

## Reminder

Per [CSU policy](https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/11030468/latest/), vaccinations and booster shots against COVID-19 are required for students, faculty, and staff to access campus facilities and participate in in-person learning and activities. All students are required to complete their COVID-19 Vaccination Self-Certification by 8/15/2022. For additional information regarding this requirement, please visit the [Student Vaccination Certification Process](https://www.csuchico.edu/coronavirus/vaccine-certification-student.shtml) page.

Chico State may at any time require the use of an approved face covering which covers the nose and mouth in all indoor campus spaces and in order to participate in this course when in person. When face coverings are optional, they are always welcome on campus. You will be notified if face coverings are required.

Policies and requirements regarding COVID-19 are subject to change pursuant to campus, local, state and/or federal guidelines. Dishonesty relating to the vaccination policy and/or your failure to comply with any COVID-19 related safety policy or mandate may result in disciplinary action against you through the office of Student Conduct, Rights and Responsibilities, which can include suspension or expulsion from the California State University system.

It is very important for students to contact the COVID-19 hotline if they become symptomatic, believe they have been exposed, or have tested positive for COVID-19. The hotline is (530) 898-2222 or covidhotline@csuchico.edu.
